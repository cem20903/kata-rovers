# Kata Setup

🥋👩‍💻 Welcome to your kata setup! 🥷

This repository provides you with a convenient setup to tackle coding katas. You can choose to run it with Docker or without it, depending on your preference.

## Getting Started

### Using Docker 🐳

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker compose build
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```
   docker compose run --rm app npm test
   ```

### Without Docker 🚀
Install dependencies locally:

```
npm install
```
Run the tests:

```
npm test
```

____________
🚨 Please make sure that the test runs successfully before the day of the kata. 🚨

Happy coding! 🚀 👩‍💻👨‍💻👩🏽‍💻👨🏻‍💻👨🏿‍💻👩🏻‍💻
